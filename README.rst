Available on `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/overalls>`_.

The `coveralls.io <http://coveralls.io>`_ coverage service is awesome
but all the coverage results need to be uploaded at once. Sometimes
one has multiple sources of coverage (e.g. tests for code in different
languages). Thus one needs a tool that can parse all sorts of coverage
results and combine them into a single submission to `coveralls.io
<http://coveralls.io>`_.

This is that tool.
